First, you'll need to enable the pgvector extension in your Supabase database. You can do this through the Supabase dashboard:
Go to your project's SQL editor
Run: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
Then, you'll need to fix the migration issues:
Delete the contents of the prisma/migrations folder
Run npx prisma migrate reset --force to reset the migrations
Run npx prisma migrate dev --name init to create a fresh migration
The schema changes I've made include:
Added vector extension support
Added embedding column to the Trade model
Added an index on the embedding column for faster similarity searches
I've also created the necessary utilities:
trade-embeddings.ts for generating and storing embeddings
Updated both trade creation paths (webhook and manual journal) to generate embeddings
The embedding system will:
Generate embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
Store them in the vector column
Allow for similarity searches using cosine similarity
Once you've completed these steps, every new trade will automatically:

1. Get stored in the SQL database
   Have an embedding generated from its details
   Be indexed for similarity searches
   You can then use the findSimilarTrades function I created to find trades with similar patterns, which is useful for:
   Pattern recognition
   Trade analysis
   Learning from past experiences
   Identifying recurring market conditions
